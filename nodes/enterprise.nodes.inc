That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:

  </ul>
  <p>By submitting Content to @site_name for inclusion on your Website, you grant @site_name a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting your blog. If you delete Content, @site_name will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Website, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.</p>
  <p>Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, @site_name has the right (though not the obligation) to, in @site_name’s sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in @site_name’s reasonable opinion, violates any @site_name policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Website to any individual or entity for any reason, in @site_name’s sole discretion. @site_name will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.

If you believe that material located on or linked to by @site_name violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify @site_name. @site_name will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material.

In the case of such termination, @site_name will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to @site_name.</li>

All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability. <strong><br>

  <ul>
  <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
  <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
  <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
  <li>In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/\" rel=\"license\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"right\" alt=\"Creative Commons License\" src=\"http://creativecommons.org/images/public/somerights20\"></a> (Note, we’ve decided to make this privacy policy available under a <strong>Creative Commons Sharealike</strong> license, which means you’re more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use, just make sure to replace references to us with ones to you, and if you want we’d appreciate a link to @site_name somewhere on your site. We spent a lot of money and time on the below, and other people shouldn’t need to do the same.)</p>
  <p>It is @site_name’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
  <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
  <p>Like most website operators, @site_name collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. @site_name’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how @site_name’s visitors use its website. From time to time, @site_name may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
  <p>@site_name also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on @site_name blogs. @site_name only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
  <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
  <p>Certain visitors to @site_name’s websites choose to interact with @site_name in ways that require @site_name to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that @site_name gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Those who engage in transactions with @site_name are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, @site_name collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with @site_name. @site_name does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
  <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
  <p>@site_name may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. @site_name may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, @site_name does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
  <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
  <p>@site_name discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on @site_name’s behalf or to provide services available at @site_name’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using @site_name’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. @site_name will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, @site_name discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when @site_name believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of @site_name, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an @site_name website and have supplied your email address, @site_name may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with @site_name and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. @site_name takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
  <h3>Cookies</h3>
  <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. @site_name uses cookies to help @site_name identify and track visitors, their usage of @site_name website, and their website access preferences. @site_name visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using @site_name’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of @site_name’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
  <h3>Ads</h3>
  <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by @site_name and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
  <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
  <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, @site_name may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in @site_name’s sole discretion. @site_name encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>',
